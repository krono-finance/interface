# Krono Finance 🕒

**Your All-in-One DeFi Hub on Lisk**  
A decentralized all-in-one DeFi platform for emerging economies

---

## 🌍 Vision

**Krono Finance** is building a decentralized financial system tailored for the next billion Web3 users — starting in Southeast Asia.

We aim to provide seamless, low-cost, and permissionless access to essential financial tools: **lending**, **borrowing**, **staking**, **swapping**, and **yield strategies** — all in one composable protocol.

Our MVP focuses on **Lending & Borrowing**, built on **Lisk’s Ethereum Layer 2**, and powered by the **IDRX** stablecoin (Indonesian Rupiah-pegged).

## ⚡ MVP: Lending & Borrowing

The first module of Krono Finance provides a decentralized market where users can:
--
### 🟢 Lend
Supply supported assets (e.g., **IDRX**) to earn interest.

### 🔴 Borrow
Lock your crypto as collateral and borrow against it with dynamic interest rates.

### 🔐 Secure
Over-collateralized loans reduce protocol risk. Liquidation logic ensures solvency.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Traditional finance in emerging markets is:

- 🏦 Centralized and exclusionary
- 💸 Costly and inefficient
- 💤 Lacking real yield or DeFi options

**Krono Finance** solves this by:
- Launching on **Lisk**, an Ethereum L2 with near-zero gas fees.
- Using **IDRX**, a local stablecoin that resonates with Indonesian users.
- Enabling seamless onboarding via **Xellar Kit Wallet**.
- Building modular DeFi infrastructure that can expand quickly from lending to looping strategies.
